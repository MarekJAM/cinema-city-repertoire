    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p>
      In case of an error in the app some data may be collected (through third-party
      products, like Crashlytics). This Log Data may include information such as your device
      model, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
      utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and
      other statistics.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
      websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may
      use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
      information and improve their services. You have the option to either
      accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
      your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to
      use some portions of this Service.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      The app does not store any personal information, so there is nothing to protect.
      It may contain links to other sites though, so remember that no method of transmission 
      over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, 
      and nobody can guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
      assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
      of any third-party sites or services.
