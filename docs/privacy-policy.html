        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>
            built the Cinema City Repertuar app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is
            provided by at no cost and is intended for use as is.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
            collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided
            to use my Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use
            of information in relation to this policy. The data that is collected is used 
            for providing and improving the Service. No personal data will be collected or shared
            with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            The app does not collect any personal information explicitly, nor it ever will.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                The app does use third-party services though that may collect information used
                to identify you.
            </p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>
            In case of an error in the app some data may be collected (through third-party
            products, like Crashlytics). This Log Data may include information such as your device
            model, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
            utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and
            other statistics.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
            anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
            websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may
            use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect
            information and improve their services. You have the option to either
            accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
            your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to
            use some portions of this Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The app does not store any personal information, so there is nothing to protect.
            It may contain links to other sites though, so remember that no method of transmission 
            over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, 
            and nobody can guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
            third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
            external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
            review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
            assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
            of any third-party sites or services.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised
            to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
            changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
        <p>This policy is effective as of 2024-03-09</p>
